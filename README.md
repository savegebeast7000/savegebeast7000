# Hello World!&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savegebeast7000/savegebeast7000/main/IKNm.gif" width="30px">
My name is Aycen but you can call me "savage" I am in 9th grade and I'm a person who is **obsessed** with the idea of improving.

# Projects&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savegebeast7000/savegebeast7000/main/S-AHunterxHunter-49x264-vorbis603A2DACmkv_snapshot_1225_20120705_180231.png" width="55px">
Ive been working on some projects such as Synapse Z which is Synapse X but hopefully better in the future.
I am also working on PeelyFN which is a Fortnite private server that is hybrid and will hopefully allow you to play in-game
**Syanpse Z is currently discontinued :( **

# More About Me
